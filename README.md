# RISCV-CPU(single Clock Cycle)
Designed and implemented a RISC - V CPU based on the instruction set architecture and also designed key modules such as ALU, Memory unit, register file and control signals. Verified the design module through testbench and analyzed the simulation waveforms. All the designs and testbench coding was done in verilog and systemverilog.
